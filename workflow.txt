Description on the workflow for running the python scripts

*** Run once per season ***

1. BA/TotalEvents
	This will grab all FRC events for the current year and populate the
	BlueAllianceEvents table
	
2. BA/TotalTeamList
	This will grab all FRC teams for the current year and populate the
	Teams table
	
*** Setup to scout a competition

1. Manually add an event to the Events table making sure to get the correct BAEventID
	from the BlueAllianceEvents table. Set the CurrentEvent column to 1 for the 
	event
	
2. BA/CurrentEventTeamList
	This will lookup the current event from the Events table along with the BAEventID
	and grab the Teams for the current event and populate the BlueAllianceTeams
	table
	
3. BA/Schedule
	This will lookup the current event from the Events table along with the BAEventID
	and grab the match schedule for the current event and populate the
	BlueAllianceSchedule table
	
4. createCurrentEventTeams
	This will populate the CurrentEventTeams table with information from the 
	BlueAllianceTeams table
	
5. createMatches
	This will take the BlueAllianceSchedule table and build matches for the current
	event in the Matches table. Any new matches will be created and any changes
	to existing records will be updated
	
6. createMatchScoutingRecords
	This will build the match scouting records based on the Matches table. Like the
	createMatches script, bit will update records that have changed in case the schedule
	changed during a competition
	
7 createMatchScoutingL2Records
	***** This needs to be tested for rapid react *****
	
*** Scripts that run during a competition

1. analysisIR
	This will take match scouting records from the MatchScouting table and create the
	CurrentEventAnalysis table ready for table builds for visualization
	
2. graphIR
	This will take the CEA table and create a new table, CurrentEventAnalysisGraphs table
	that lay out the data on a per team basis with selected analysis types in columns
	that is easily suited for making bar graphs of the data
